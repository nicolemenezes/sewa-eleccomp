  <pre>Electronics â€“ branch of physics, engineering and technology dealing with electrical circuits that involve active semiconductor components and associated passive interconnection technologies.
    
   Below is a summary of common electronic components:

    
  1. Resistors
  Function: Resistors limit the flow of electric current in a circuit. They are used to control voltage and current levels.
    
  Types: Fixed resistors, variable resistors (potentiometers), thermistors.

    
  2. Capacitors
  Function: Capacitors store and release electrical energy in a circuit. They are used for filtering, timing, and energy storage.
    
  Types: Electrolytic, ceramic, tantalum, film capacitors.

    
  3. Inductors
  Function: Inductors store energy in a magnetic field when electrical current flows through them. They are used in filters, transformers, and energy storage.
    
  Types: Air core, iron core, and ferrite core inductors.

    
  4. Diodes
  Function: Diodes allow current to flow in one direction only, acting as a one-way valve for electricity. They are used for rectification, protection, and signal demodulation.
    
  Types: Standard diodes, Zener diodes, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), Schottky diodes.

    
  5. Transistors
  Function: Transistors are used to amplify or switch electronic signals and power. They are the building blocks of modern electronic devices.
    
  Types: Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), field-effect transistors (FETs), metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs).

    
  6. Integrated Circuits (ICs)
  Function: ICs are miniaturized circuits that integrate multiple electronic components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors into a single chip. They perform a wide range of functions, from simple logic operations to complex signal processing.
    
  Types: Analog ICs, digital ICs, mixed-signal ICs.

    
  7. Relays
  Function: Relays are electromechanical switches that open or close a circuit in response to an electrical signal. They are used to control high-power devices with low-power signals.
    
  Types: Electromechanical relays, solid-state relays.

    
  8. Switches
  Function: Switches manually open or close an electrical circuit, controlling the flow of electricity.
    
  Types: Toggle switches, push-button switches, rotary switches, DIP switches.

    
  9. Sensors
  Function: Sensors detect and respond to physical inputs like light, temperature, motion, or pressure and convert them into electrical signals.
    
  Types: Temperature sensors, light sensors (photodiodes), proximity sensors, accelerometers.

    
  10. Connectors
  Function: Connectors join electrical circuits together, providing a secure connection between different components or devices.
    
  Types: Plugs, sockets, terminal blocks, headers.

    
  11. Transformers
  Function: Transformers transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction, typically changing the voltage level.
    
  Types: Step-up transformers, step-down transformers, isolation transformers.

    
  12. Oscillators
  Function: Oscillators generate periodic waveforms, such as sine waves or square waves. They are used in clocks, timers, and signal generators.
    
  Types: Crystal oscillators, RC oscillators, LC oscillators.

    
  13. Microcontrollers
  Function: Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits designed to govern specific operations in embedded systems. They include a CPU, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip.
    
  Applications: Used in automation, robotics, and consumer electronics.

    
  14. Power Supplies
  Function: Power supplies convert and regulate electrical power for electronic circuits, ensuring they receive the correct voltage and current.
    
  Types: Linear power supplies, switching power supplies, battery power supplies.

    
  15. Batteries
  Function: Batteries store chemical energy and convert it to electrical energy to power electronic devices.
    
  Types: Alkaline, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, lead-acid.

    
  These components are often combined in various configurations to create electronic devices, ranging from simple circuits like LED flashlights to complex systems like computers and smartphones.
